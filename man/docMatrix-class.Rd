\description{
\code{docMatrix} creates a special \code{tei2r} object that
represents a document collection as a matrix of words
}

\describe{
\item{\code{directory}}{A string that gives the filepath to the main directory}

\item{\code{indexFile}}{A string that gives the filepath to the index file for the
collection.}

\item{\code{type}}{A string: either "docTerm" for a document-term matrix, or "wordContext"
for a word-context matrix.}

\item{\code{mat}}{A matrix of words.}
}}
\section{What it does}{

The \code{docMatrix} object holds a vector-space model of
your document collection. The two most common vector-space models (which
are the only two currently supported in \code{tei2r}) are document-term
matrices and word-context matrices. In a document-term matrix, each column is
a document in the collection, and each row is a word found in that document. In
a word-context matrix, each column is a keyword, and each row is a context term
found within a window of that keyword.
