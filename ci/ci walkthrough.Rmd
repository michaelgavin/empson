## Introduction

This document provides a walkthrough for the article, "Vector Semantics, William Empson, and the Study of Ambiguity" *Critical Inquiry* (2018), for figures 7 through 14. Here you can see how to access the data used in the article and recreate (see caveat below) the visualizations in the piece.

### Caveat and Apology

Here's where I must apologize to any readers interested in recreating the exact images that appear in the article. I failed to preserve the scripts used when generating the charts and so I'm not sure exactly which parameters I used. As a result, following the commands below will result in slightly different layouts and slightly different most-similar word lists. These differences do not, I trust, affect the main points I'm hoping to make in the article, but they represent very bad form on my part and, again, I apologize. Any excuse I make would be a combination of "the dog ate my homework" and "I'm just an English professor, what can you expect me to know about repeatability?" In any case, I'm trying to be better with this kind of thing.

### Where to find the data and functions


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
load("C:/Users/mgavin/Downloads/m1640_1699.RData")
library(empson)

n = m
avgs = apply(m, 1, mean)
devs = apply(m, 1, sd)

for (j in 1:ncol(n)) {
  print(j)
  n[,j] = (n[,j] - avgs) / devs
}

similarity_map(n, "foot")

vec = m["square",] + m["foot",]
similarity_map(n, vec)

similarity_map(n, "space")
similarity_map(n, "evil")
similarity_map(n, "abstracted")
similarity_map(n, "stood")

vec = m["space",] + m["evil",] + m["abstracted",] + m["stood",]
similarity_map(n, vec, numResults = 50)

passage = "Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire Of gesture or lest action overawd His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: That space the Evil one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remaind Stupidly good, of enmity disarm’d  Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, Though in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight, And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites"
passage = unlist(strsplit(passage, split = "\\W"))
passage = tolower(passage)
passage = passage[passage %in% rownames(m)]

vec = colSums(n[passage,])
similarity_map(n, "foot", numResults = 100, numGrps = 6)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
